# Interfaces / Abstraction

# so far we've built concrete classes 

class Book:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Book name is: {self.name}")

class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Product name is {self.name}")


# let's move one level higher than just concrete classes.

# instead of asking what one object does, we ask what a whole category of objects should be able to do.


# in the examples above, we see that our classes might behave in a similar way and we want to think of 
# abstraction as a way that allows us to design our code.

# in here, abstraction means focusing on the essential behaviour, while hiding unnecessary details.


# Imagine a payment system --> every payment method must have a pay(amount) operation

# but!!    a credit card pays one way -- PayPal pays another way -- bank transfer works differently , etc.

# the shared  idea for the above:  is the abstraction "a payment method can make a payment"

# abstraction allows us to have 
# 1. clearer design
# 2. less duplication
# 3. easier extension
# 4. more consistent behaviour
# 5. in case of larger code bases: better teamwork and maintainability

# let's get practical now!
        
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):

    def area(self):

#another example

    @abstractmethod
    def payment(self, amount):

            print(f"{amount} withdrawn!")
            self.balance += amount
class PayPal(FInancialInstitution):
    def __init__(self, card_number, debit_balance):
        self.card_number = card_number
        self.debit_balance = debit_balance

    fi.payment(amount)
    
checkout(50, visa_card)

#another example foe explanation
# i want to have multiple animal classes (dog, cat, etc.)
# i want them all to be able to speak

class Animal(ABC): #Abstract Base Class
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    # we don't really need a constructor for now
    voice = "Woof"

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.voice}")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Meow")

dog1 = Dog()
cat1 = Cat()

# this is valid
dog1.speak()
cat1.speak()

# this is not a must
# this is a choice
#                        this is also valid!
def animal_sound(animal):
    animal.speak()

animal_sound(dog1)
animal_sound(cat1)

# With abstraction:
# 1. The design is clearer (it's intentional!)
# 2. subclasses are required to implement the method
# 3. the shared purpose is explicit!
